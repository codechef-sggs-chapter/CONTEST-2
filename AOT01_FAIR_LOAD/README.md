In the city of Mitras, The Survey Corps is the branch of the Military most actively involved in direct Titan combat, Titan study, human expansion, and outside exploration. Titans are a race of humanoid giants that normal people don’t want to get hurt by.

So Survey Corps are now going outside the Wall for exploration under the commander Hange Zoë. Survey corps use horses for exploration purposes as horses can weigh food for them and they are mobile. So initially all n horses were weighing some <b>w1,w2,w3,...wn </b>
weight of grain’s sack before the commander arrived at the camp.

Hange is that kind of personality who wants an equal amount of weight of grains on each horse they are having with them, that is no horse will weigh less no horse will weigh more. To do this Hange came up with a solution to have weight on each horse equal to the average value of the initial weights on all the horses.

## Input

- First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- First line of each test case contains a single integer N
- Second line of each test case contains N weights w1,w2,w3,...wn
  of grain’s sacks initially each horse was loaded with. Given that the sacks can carry any amount of weight

## Output

For each test case, you have to print a single integer on a new line which will tell the exact weight (floor value of average weight) each horse should weigh

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1e3
- 1 ≤ wi ≤ 1e6
