# Impressing Mikasa

Training in the Training Corps is quite difficult for everyone, so everyone once in a while takes a break from them and has fun. Today’s game is different, it's between Mikasa′s
and Annie′s
team. The game goes like this, one team takes a very long number, writes it on a long sheet of paper such that every digit is side-by-side. After writing the number they tear the paper into small pieces of any length such that the numbers are still readable on the pieces. The other team has to create a very large number from all the pieces, without tampering the pieces.

This time it is Annie′s
Team’s chance to write the number. You have a crush on Mikasa
and want to help her create that number.

You will be given n
strings of any length. You will have to put all the strings together such that you will get the largest number formed from the strings after joining them.

## Input

First line of input will have T, number of test cases. First line of each test case will have n, number of pieces. Followed by n, strings si.

## Output

Output T strings on newline, where each line will have the largest possible string which can be made out of corresponding pieces.

## Constraints

- 1≤T≤10
- 1≤n≤100
- 1≤|si|≤1000

## Sample Input
